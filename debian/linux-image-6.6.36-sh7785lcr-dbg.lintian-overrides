# glibc doesn't seem to check for a PT_GNU_STACK section in vDSOs, so
# it's OK that they don't have it

# It is intended that 64-bit kernels provide vDSOs for 32-bit executables.
# lintian currently allows i386 executables on amd64.

# Some 32-bit architectures need 64-bit kernels and we still build
# these as the "wrong" architecture rather than mandating multiarch.
