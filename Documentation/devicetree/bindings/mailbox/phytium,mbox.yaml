description: |
  The Phytium mailbox controller that has a channel/link to communicate
  with the remote end. A link raises interrupt for any received data. However,
  there is no specified way of knowing if the sent data has been read by the
  remote. This driver assumes the sender polls STAT register and the remote
  clears it after having read the data.
