config KEXEC

	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel. It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware. And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you. As of this writing the exact hardware
	  interface is strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be
	  made.

config CRASH_DUMP
	bool "Kernel crash dumps (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  Generate crash dump after being started by kexec.
	  This should be normally only set in special crash dump kernels
	  which are loaded in the main kernel with kexec-tools into
	  a specially reserved region and then later executed after
	  a crash by kdump/kexec. The crash dump kernel must be compiled

config SECCOMP

	prompt "Enable seccomp to safely compute untrusted bytecode"
	help
	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications
	  that may need to compute untrusted bytecode during their
	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
	  enabled via prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP), it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.

	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,

	help
	  This option provides support for runtime services provided
	  by UEFI firmware (such as non-volatile variables, realtime
	  clock, and platform reset). A UEFI stub is also provided to
	  allow the kernel to be booted as an EFI application. This

config DMI
	bool "Enable support for SMBIOS (DMI) tables"
	depends on EFI
	default y
	help
	  This enables SMBIOS/DMI feature for systems.

	  This option is only useful on systems that have UEFI firmware.
	  However, even with this option, the resultant kernel should
	  continue to boot on existing non-UEFI platforms.

	  NOTE: This does *NOT* enable or encourage the use of DMI quirks,
	  i.e., the practice of identifying the platform via DMI to
	  decide whether certain workarounds for buggy hardware and/or
	  firmware need to be enabled. This would require the DMI subsystem
	  to be enabled much earlier than we do on ARM, which is non-trivial.

config CMDLINE_BOOL
	bool "Built-in kernel command line"
	help
	  Allow for specifying boot arguments to the kernel at
	  build time. On some systems (e.g. embedded ones), it is
	  necessary or convenient to provide some or all of the
	  kernel boot arguments with the kernel itself (that is,
	  to not rely on the boot loader to provide them.)

	  To compile command line arguments into the kernel,
	  set this option to 'Y', then fill in the
	  boot arguments in CONFIG_CMDLINE.

	  Systems with fully functional boot loaders (i.e. non-embedded)
	  should leave this option set to 'N'.

config CMDLINE
	string "Built-in kernel command string"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	default ""
	help
	  Enter arguments here that should be compiled into the kernel
	  image and used at boot time. If the boot loader provides a
	  command line at boot time, it is appended to this string to
	  form the full kernel command line, when the system boots.

	  However, you can use the CONFIG_CMDLINE_OVERRIDE option to
	  change this behavior.

	  In most cases, the command line (whether built-in or provided
	  by the boot loader) should specify the device for the root
	  file system.

config CMDLINE_OVERRIDE
	bool "Built-in command line overrides boot loader arguments"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	help
	  Set this option to 'Y' to have the kernel ignore the boot loader
	  command line, and use ONLY the built-in command line.

	  This is used to work around broken boot loaders. This should
	  be set to 'N' under normal conditions.

config FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER
	int
	default "16" if (HUGETLB_PAGE)
	default "11"
	help
	  The kernel memory allocator divides physically contiguous memory
	  blocks into "zones", where each zone is a power of two number of
	  pages. This option selects the largest power of two that the kernel
	  keeps in the memory allocator. If you need to allocate very large
	  blocks of physically contiguous memory, then you may need to
	  increase this value.

	  This config option is actually maximum order plus one. For example,
	  a value of 11 means that the largest free memory block is 2^10 pages.

	  We make sure that we can allocate up to a HugePage size for each configuration.
	  Hence we have :
		MAX_ORDER = (PMD_SHIFT - PAGE_SHIFT) + 1 => PAGE_SHIFT - 2
