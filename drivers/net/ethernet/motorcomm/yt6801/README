<Linux device driver for Motorcomm Ethernet controllers>

	This is the Linux device driver released for Motorcomm YT6801 Gigabit
	Ethernet controllers with PCI-Express interface.

<Set the network related information>
	1. Set manually
		a. Set the IP address of your machine.

			# ifconfig ethX "the IP address of your machine"

		b. Set the IP address of DNS.

		   Insert the following configuration in /etc/resolv.conf.

			nameserver "the IP address of DNS"

		c. Set the IP address of gateway.

			# route add default gw "the IP address of gateway"

	2. Set by doing configurations in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
	   /ifcfg-ethX for Redhat and Fedora, or /etc/sysconfig/network
	   /ifcfg-ethX for SuSE. There are two examples to set network
	   configurations.

		a. Fixed IP address:
			DEVICE=eth0
			BOOTPROTO=static
			ONBOOT=yes
			TYPE=ethernet
			NETMASK=255.255.255.0
			IPADDR=192.168.1.1
			GATEWAY=192.168.1.254
			BROADCAST=192.168.1.255

		b. DHCP:
			DEVICE=eth0
			BOOTPROTO=dhcp
			ONBOOT=yes

<Modify the MAC address>
	There are two ways to modify the MAC address of the NIC.
	1. Use ifconfig:

		# ifconfig ethX hw ether YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY

	   ,where X is the device number assigned by Linux kernel, and
		  YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY is the MAC address assigned by the user.

	2. Use ip:

		# ip link set ethX address YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY

	   ,where X is the device number assigned by Linux kernel, and
		  YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY is the MAC address assigned by the user.

<Force Link Status>

	Force the link status by using ethtool.
		a. Insert the driver first.
		b. Make sure that ethtool exists in /sbin.
		c. Force the link status as the following command.

			# ethtool -s ethX speed SPEED_MODE duplex DUPLEX_MODE autoneg NWAY_OPTION

			,where
				SPEED_MODE	= 1000	for 1000Mbps
						= 100	for 100Mbps
						= 10	for 10Mbps
				DUPLEX_MODE	= half	for half-duplex
						= full	for full-duplex
				NWAY_OPTION	= off	for auto-negotiation off (true force)
						= on	for auto-negotiation on (nway force)

		For example:

			# ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full autoneg on

		will force PHY to operate in 100Mpbs Full-duplex(nway force).

<Jumbo Frame>
	Transmitting Jumbo Frames, whose packet size is bigger than 1500 bytes, please change mtu by the following command.

	# ifconfig ethX mtu MTU

	, where X=0,1,2,..., and MTU is configured by user.

	YT6801 supports Jumbo Frame size up to 9 kBytes.
